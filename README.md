# 🔑 Key Tag Detector Circuit

## 📌 Project Overview
This project is a **Key Tag Detector Circuit** that produces a tone when two consecutive hand claps occur within a **3-second** duration. The circuit is designed using **555 Timer ICs** and follows the guidelines provided by the University of Jaffna, Faculty of Engineering.

## 🎯 Objectives
- 🛠️ Apply electrical and electronics theory to solve a practical problem.
- 🔍 Familiarize with electronic components and circuit design.
- 🖨️ Gain knowledge in **PCB fabrication** and assembly.

## 🏗️ Design & Implementation
### 📜 Circuit Design
The circuit consists of **three 555 Timer ICs**, each serving a specific function:
1. **Monostable Mode (3 sec)** – Detects two consecutive claps within 3 seconds.
2. **Monostable Mode (10 sec)** – Activates the buzzer for 10 seconds.
3. **Astable Mode** – Generates the beep sound for the buzzer.

### 🔬 Simulation & PCB Design
- **Phase 01**: Designed and simulated using **Proteus**. ✅
- **Phase 02**: Implemented and tested on a **Breadboard**. ✅
- **Phase 03**: Redesigned in **Altium** and routed as a **Double Layer PCB**. ✅

## 🖨️ PCB Fabrication Process
- Used **Toner Transfer Paper** to transfer the design onto a double-layer board.
- Components were soldered after etching the PCB.
